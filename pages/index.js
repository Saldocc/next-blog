          I've been working on software development since 2016. But I've been working professionally as a frontend developer since October 2019. I'm passionate about Javascript, React and Frontend Technologies.

          I love being an electrical and electronics engineer -especially electronics- but I think specializing in software will be more enjoyable in the future as it is now. I love looking at the code screen. It reminds me of infinite space that gives me freedom. Also, waiting to be discovered. Other things that interest me are -especially management games- Games, Football and Robotic.
